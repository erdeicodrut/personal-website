      <description>In the past years I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to have a home server for some reason, but my formation as a programmer who did leetcode style problems from the age of 10 it was really hard for me to bear the inefficiency of having a Linux machine running 24/7 in my home.
Having been semi-cured of that issue let&amp;rsquo;s jump in the actual config.
The config Starting out with the computer I chose for a server was a Dell OptiPlex 7050 Micro that I bought refurbished from a local company for around $140, plus I had to get an SSD because the one that came with it had too many bad sectors; so I got an SSD for ~$35 and that was that.</description>
