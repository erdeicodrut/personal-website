      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Linux for more than 6 years and then moved to a Macbook Pro because of the build quality and Unix compliancy. I had a 2019 13&amp;quot; base model MPB (i5) which was great. I built a PC (Ryzen 9 w/ some AMD GPU) on which I carried on the same Arch (btw) install for more than 2 years. I exchanged all that for a 2021 14&amp;quot; MBP (M1 Pro) and never cared about anything released since.</description>

      <description>In the past years I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to have a home server for some reason, but my formation as a programmer who did leetcode style problems from the age of 10 made it really hard for me to bear the inefficiency of having a Linux machine running 24/7 in my home.
Having been semi-cured of that issue let&amp;rsquo;s jump in the actual config.
The config Starting out with the computer I chose for a server: a Dell OptiPlex 7050 Micro that I bought refurbished from a local company for around $140, plus I had to get an SSD because the one that came with it had too many bad sectors; so I got an SSD for ~$35 and that was that.</description>
